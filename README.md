Simple Life Counter For A Game

## Basics
 - Runs on IceCreamSandwich or later versions of API
 - Shows four “players”. Each “player” has a label for their life total, and four pushbuttons (“+”, “-“,”+5”,”-5”).
 - When the “+” pushbutton is pushed for player 1, it increments player 1’s life total by 1. “-“  reduces the life total by 1, “+5” increments by 5, and “-5” decrements by 5.
 - When a player's life total drops to 0 or less, it displays a label at the bottom of the app saying "Player X LOSES!"
 - When the device is rotated (landscape to portrait mode or vice versa), it resizes itself evenly.
 - When the app is run on different devices, it is "equally balanced" on each device, regardless of orientation. Players' life total labels are proportional, buttons proportional, and so on.
